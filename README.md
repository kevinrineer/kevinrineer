# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin

This Github is primarily for OSS contributions. It also is a repo mirror from Gitlab and my personal Gitea instance. Many many backups.

# ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in:

-   HPC, Supercomputing, AI, and Quantum Computing
-   ML/DL solutions especially within the audio space

# ðŸŒ± Currently learning

-   Currently studying for completion of the Linux Foundation Certified Sysadmin (LFCS) track
-   ****Backburner**** Iâ€™m currently learning the skills I need to build a phoneme ASR. My first project to be completed will be an accent classifier for the English Language. I plan to follow that with an IPA transcription solution.
-   ****Backburner**** Beyond that? I&rsquo;d like to create open source applications to improve the lives of those with disabilities.

# Other notes
You might find some work for Virtual Table Tops (VTTs) on here as well. Table top role playing games are a hobby of mine and when I have extra time not playing, I like to help making tools for others to play.
