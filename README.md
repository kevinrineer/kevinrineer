# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin

This Github is primarily for OSS contributions. It also is a repo mirror from Gitlab. I'd rather use cGit or codeberg, but time is precious.

# ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in:

-   Distributed Computing (High Performance Computing)
-   Software Reproducibility (Containers, Nix, Guix)
-   Accessibility
-   Quantum Computing
-   ML/DL solutions especially with a focus on audio processing and classification

# ðŸŒ± Currently learning

-   Rust ðŸ¦€
-   Various HPC related topics
-   How Linux handles screenreaders (so, orca, odelia, accesskit, speech-dispatcher, et al.)
-   Various Linux accessibility tools.
-   Whether I want to mainly be using emacs or neovim (and enough elisp and lua to really configure them to my needs). I like emacs more, but vi{m} is more targeted to text as a use-case (and is more commonly installed).
